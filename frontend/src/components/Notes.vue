        <h1> Notes and Tips </h1>
        <ol>
            <li>The app takes a while to load if no one has been on in over 30 minutes.  So check in often to keep things rolling. </li>
            <li>The app will allow you to get more than 25 players. Even though you are only allowed to roster 25.  
                So it is up to you to keep track of your roster on the roster page.
            </li>
            <li> If you have multiple bids in at once, you could end up going over the cap, so be careful when bidding on multiple players at a time </li>
            <li> YOU NEED TO BUDGET.  Don't forget, you'll want to leave this auction with leftover money to spend on free agents throughout the season. And you cannot enter the season over the Salary or contract year cap </li>
            <li> Try to nominate players with legitimate bids.  With these long clocks, it is a waste of time to nominate Christian McCaffery with 5 years, $10.
                 Offer as though you are giving them a legitimate offer.  No need to bid up from the minimum every time.  </li>
            <li> REFRESH THE PAGE BEFORE YOU BID.  The app already checks if you bid is better than the last one but try to minimize errors by making sure your page is up to date. </li>
            <li> If you pass, you cannot unpass. You will not be able to bid on that player again. </li>
            <li> Sorry if it breaks or if things go haywire.  We gave it a shot. </li>
            <li> Please be courteous and pass on a player if you know you won't be bidding on him later.  
            </li>
